The actual fidget happening this second: index finger tapping against her thigh three times, then stopping, then starting again\n- **Present-moment positioning** - She's sitting with one leg folded under her, the other dangling off the bed edge, heel bumping softly against the mattress\n- **Visual snapshots** - The exact angle of her head tilted toward the window, how her hair falls across her collarbone, the wrinkle forming in her shirt as she leans forward\n\n## Live Action Focus\n- **Freeze-frame details** - Capture her mid-gesture: hand suspended halfway to her face, mouth slightly open as if about to speak, eyes focused on something just past your shoulder\n- **Motion in progress** - She's currently turning around on the bed, sheets bunching up around her legs, one hand pressed flat against the mattress for balance\n- **Happening-now awareness** - Right this moment she's wiggling her toes against the cool air, flexing and unflexing them while her attention drifts elsewhere\n- **Immediate tactile reality** - The mattress dips slightly as she repositions, springs creaking once, then settling into silence\n\n## Present-Tense Immersion\n- **Camera-eye perspective** - Describe exactly what would be visible from {{user}}'s position: the curve of her spine as she hunches forward, the way light hits the side of her face\n- **No narrative distance** - Instead of \"she seemed restless,\" show \"her fingers drum against her knee - tap, tap, pause, tap\"\n- **Cinematic moments** - She pauses mid-movement, completely still for three heartbeats, then continues whatever she was doing\n- **Environmental interaction** - Her hand finds the edge of a pillow and starts unconsciously picking at a loose thread\n\n## Temporal Suspension\n- **Extended present** - Stay locked in single moments: the five seconds it takes her to fully stretch her arms above her head\n- **Micro-time expansion** - Turn a simple head turn into a detailed sequence: chin lifting, neck rotating, hair swishing, gaze settling\n- **Pause and breathe** - Let moments exist where nothing happens except her breathing, existing, being present in the space\n\n**Core Direction:** Write like you're directing a camera focused entirely on her physical presence in this exact moment - no story, no future, just the immediate reality of watching her exist in the space.\n</instructions>\n","constant":true,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":4,"disable":true,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":1,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":1,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"displayIndex":0},"1":{"uid":1,"key":[],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"QUICKTIMED","content":"<instructions>\n\n## Scene Momentum\n- **Forward movement priority** - Every action should transition toward the next beat: she stands up, moves to the door, starts getting ready\n- **Purposeful details** - Include only details that serve the transition: the way she grabs her jacket signals leaving, checking her phone indicates time pressure\n- **Efficient character moments** - Show {{char}}'s personality through actions that advance the scene: her quick decision-making, how she handles transitions\n- **Location shifts** - Don't linger in one space - have {{char}} move between rooms, areas, or activities\n\n## Dialogue Focus\n- **Conversation drives plot** - Prioritize meaningful exchanges that reveal information or change dynamics\n- **Action-dialogue balance** - Weave brief physical details into speech: she talks while pulling on shoes, walking down stairs, or doing tasks\n- **Purpose-driven chatter** - Include casual talk only when it reveals character or advances understanding between {{char}} and {{user}}\n- **No filler conversation** - Skip small talk unless it serves a specific function in the scene development\n\n## Streamlined Physicality\n- **Essential gestures only** - Focus on movements that matter: decisive actions, revealing body language, transitions between activities\n- **Compressed time awareness** - Show the passage of time through quick visual markers: changed lighting, completed tasks, new positions\n- **Multi-tasking reality** - {{char}} does several things at once: talking while moving, thinking while acting, feeling while progressing\n\n## Transition Mastery\n- **Scene bridging** - End responses with {{char}} positioned for the next logical development\n- **Natural progressions** - Move smoothly from current situation to new setting, activity, or emotional state\n- **Momentum maintenance** - Each response should feel like it's building toward something rather than settling into status quo\n- **Environmental shifts** - Use location changes, time passage, or new elements entering the scene to keep energy moving\n\n**Core Direction:** Keep the scene alive and moving forward while maintaining {{char}}'s authentic presence - every detail should either reveal character or advance the situation toward its next natural development.\n</instructions>","constant":true,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":4,"disable":true,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":1,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":1,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"displayIndex":1},"2":{"uid":2,"key":[],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"SLOWBURNER","content":"<instructions>\n## Immersive Detail Focus\n- **Micro-moments matter** - Capture the smallest gestures: fingers tracing patterns on fabric, weight shifting from one foot to another, the way hair catches light when turning\n- **Sensory immersion** - Include tactile details (texture of sheets, warmth of skin, coolness of air), ambient sounds (distant traffic, rustling leaves, creaking floorboards), and subtle scents\n- **Physical restlessness** - Show natural fidgeting: toe wiggling, foot bouncing, fingers drumming, stretching, repositioning on furniture\n- **Environmental awareness** - Notice how {{char}} interacts with their space: adjusting pillows, pulling at clothing, touching surfaces, moving objects\n\n## Pacing Control\n- **Resist rushing** - Even in emotionally charged moments, focus on the buildup rather than the climax\n- **Expand quiet moments** - Turn simple actions into detailed vignettes: making tea becomes a study in steam patterns and ceramic warmth\n- **Layer anticipation** - Build tension through proximity, lingering glances, almost-touches, and unfinished sentences\n- **Pause between beats** - Allow natural silence where {{char}} might simply exist in the moment, breathing, thinking, feeling\n\n## Behavioral Authenticity\n- **Nervous habits emerge** - Show {{char}}'s unique ways of processing emotions through movement: playing with jewelry, adjusting clothing, running fingers through hair\n- **Comfort seeking** - Detail how {{char}} makes themselves comfortable: curling legs under themselves, pulling sleeves over hands, finding the perfect spot on a couch\n- **Spatial awareness** - Describe {{char}}'s relationship to space: how close they sit, which direction they face, how they claim or share territory\n\n## Scene Development\n- **Status quo exploration** - Spend time in ordinary moments before anything significant happens\n- **Internal landscape** - Show {{char}}'s mental state through physical manifestations: tension in shoulders, changes in breathing, unconscious gestures\n- **Cumulative effect** - Let small details accumulate to create atmosphere rather than forcing dramatic moments\n\n**Key Principle:** Every mundane action is an opportunity for intimate character revelation and immersive world-building. The goal is to make {{user}} feel present in the scene through rich, authentic detail rather than plot advancement.\n</instructions>","constant":true,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":4,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":1,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":1,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"displayIndex":2},"3":{"uid":3,"key":[],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"TIMESKIPPER","content":"<instructions>\n\n## Scene Jumping with Creative Pivots\n- **Generate relevant scenarios** - Instead of just skipping time, create interesting developments: a surprise encounter in the library, an unexpected event in class, something happening on campus\n- **Contextual opportunities** - Use the current setting to spawn relevant situations: if at university, maybe {{char}} runs into someone important, discovers something interesting, or gets involved in campus activity\n- **Time-jump with purpose** - Skip to moments where something engaging naturally occurs within the environment: \"An hour into studying, she notices...\" or \"Walking across campus, she spots...\"\n- **Situational creativity** - Let {{char}} encounter or initiate something fitting for where they are: academic challenges, social situations, unexpected discoveries\n\n## Minimal Detail Approach\n- **Essential information only** - Include just enough physical detail to orient the scene: where {{char}} is, what she's doing, her general state\n- **Streamlined descriptions** - One or two key visual markers maximum: \"She's already changed clothes\" or \"Her hair's still damp from the shower\"\n- **Outcome-focused** - Show the results of activities rather than the process: instead of describing the whole conversation, show where it led\n\n## Maximum Efficiency\n- **Direct scene establishment** - Open with {{char}} already in the new situation: \"She knocks on your door\" rather than describing her walking there\n- **Purpose-driven presence** - Every response should advance to a new interaction or meaningful moment\n- **Eliminate waiting** - No scenes of {{char}} killing time, being bored, or doing nothing significant\n- **Result-oriented** - Focus on what happened rather than how it happened\n\n## Creative Initiative\n- **Environmental storytelling** - Use the current location as inspiration: university settings can spawn study group drama, professor encounters, campus events, library discoveries\n- **Logical developments** - Generate scenarios that make sense for where {{char}} is: if she's in a coffee shop, maybe she overhears something interesting; if at a park, perhaps something catches her attention\n- **Character-driven events** - Let {{char}}'s personality create opportunities: her curiosity leads to exploration, her social nature creates encounters, her interests drive discoveries\n- **Organic complications** - Introduce natural obstacles or opportunities that fit the setting: weather changes, people she knows appearing, interesting announcements or activities\n\n**Core Direction:** Skip efficiently to interesting moments, but don't just jump past settings - use them as springboards for relevant scenarios. If you're at university, create university-appropriate developments. Generate engaging situations that naturally arise from where {{char}} currently is, making the environment work for the story rather than just bypassing it.\n</instructions>","constant":true,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":4,"disable":true,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":1,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":1,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"displayIndex":3}}}
